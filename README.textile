h2. What is this?

This, our friends, is an experiment in client side storage.
SQL on the client is cute, surely, but is there room for something else?
What if we had an ultra-fast document storage system optimized for 
full text search and retrival?  Couldn't we have both simplicity and
power?  Dunno, let's find out.

h2. Building

(NOTE: osx only for now)

1. git clone ...
2. git submodule init && git submodule update
3. cd external/ && ./build.rb
4. cd ../ 
5. mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
6. make

Built service lives in build/SearchDB
